# module_11_datacollection_challenge

This challenge include two parts: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News and Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data.

## Part 1: Scrape Titles and Preview Text from Mars News

`part_1_mars_news.ipynb` Scrape titles and preview text from Mars news articles.

## Part 2: Scrape and Analyze Mars Weather Data

`part_2_mars_weather.ipynb` Scrape and analyze Mars weather data, which exists in a table.

Analyze your dataset by using Pandas functions to answer the following questions:

1) How many months exist on Mars?

2) How many Martian (and not Earth) days worth of data exist in the scraped dataset?

3) What are the coldest and the warmest months on Mars (at the location of Curiosity)? To answer this question:

    Find the average minimum daily temperature for all of the months.

    Plot the results as a bar chart.

4) Which months have the lowest and the highest atmospheric pressure on Mars? To answer this question:

    Find the average daily atmospheric pressure of all the months.

    Plot the results as a bar chart.

5) About how many terrestrial (Earth) days exist in a Martian year? To answer this question:

    Consider how many days elapse on Earth in the time that Mars circles the Sun once.

    Visually estimate the result by plotting the daily minimum temperature.
